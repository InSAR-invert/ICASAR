# ICASAR
An algorithm for robustly appling sICA to InSAR data in order to isolate deformation signals and atmospheric signals.  

Gaddes et al., 2019 details its application to Sierra Negra (Galapagos Archipelago, Ecuador), where it was able to isolate the caldera floor uplift signal (source 1), and a topograhically correlated atmospheric phase screen (source 2):

The algorithm also provides tools to visualise the recovered sources in order for a user to determine how robust they are.  Note that the sources capturing the caldera floor uplift (blue points), form an isolated and compact cluster:
